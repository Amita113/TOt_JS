1. String character "pune"
2. Number limit 22
3. Bigint 
4. Boolean true or false
5. Undefined var xyz;
6. Null  var z=" "
7. Symbol ES6

 With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit

JavaScript Symbols
JavaScript Symbols are a new type of primitive data type introduced in the ES6 version of the language. They are used to represent unique values that can be used as identifiers or keys in objects. They are also used to create private properties and methods in classes.

Why should you use it?
Symbols are unique and immutable, so they can be used as unique identifiers in objects and classes.
Symbols can be used to create private properties and methods in classes.
Symbols are useful for creating constants that can be shared across different parts of your code.
