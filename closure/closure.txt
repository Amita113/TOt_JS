scope chain and lexical environment

scope as a boundary till where we can access variables

lexical heirarichy , nested things fun1(fun2())
function func1()
{
    lexical enviroment  will be created
    function func2()
{
    lexical enviroment  will be created
    
}
}
finding varibles in nested functions is called scope chain

inverse lexical scope does not work var declared in  and 
inner function and consloe in outer scope then it does not
work


A closure is a feature of JavaScript that allows inner functions to access the outer scope of a function. Closure helps in binding a function to its outer boundary and is created automatically whenever a function is created.
