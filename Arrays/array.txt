An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];


Creating an Array
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:

const array_name = [item1, item2, ...]; 

---------------------------------------------------------


You can also create an array, and then provide the elements:

Eg:
const cars = [];
cars[0]= "Saab";
cars[1]= "Volvo";
cars[2]= "BMW";

Array Elements Can Be Objects
JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:

myArray[0] = Date.now;
myArray[1] = myFunction;
myArray[2] = myCars;

---------------------------------------------------------

Array Properties and Methods
The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods:

cars.length   // Returns the number of elements
cars.sort()   // Sorts the array

---------------------------------------------------------

The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  

In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

const person = [];
person["firstName"] = "John";
person["lastName"] = "Doe";
person["age"] = 46;
person.length;     // Will return 0
person[0]; 


When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects.
JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.

JavaScript new Array()
JavaScript has a built-in array constructor new Array().

But you can safely use [] instead.

These two different statements both create a new array containing 6 numbers:

const points = new Array(40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10);
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];

primitive: number , 
non-primitves: which can hold more than one type of
