<h1>JavaScript Arrays</h1>
<h2>The join() Method</h2>

<p>The join() method joins array elements into a string.</p>
<p>It this example we have used " * " as a separator between the elements:</p>

<p>The join() method also joins all array elements into a string.

 It behaves just like toString(), but in addition you can specify the separator: *</p>
 
<p id="first"></p>

<script>
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
document.getElementById("first").innerHTML = fruits.join(" * ");
</script>

<p>Popping and Pushing
    When you work with arrays, it is easy to remove elements and add new elements.
    
    This is what popping and pushing is:
    
    Popping items out of an array, or pushing items into an array.</p>

    <p id="demo2"></p>
<script>
    const fruits1 = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
   
fruits1.pop();
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = fruits1;

  
fruits1.push("Kiwi");

//The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index.

//The unshift() method adds a new element to an array (at the beginning), and "unshifts" older elements:

//The length property provides an easy way to append a new element to an array:

// Array elements can be deleted using the JavaScript operator delete.

//Using delete leaves undefined holes in the array.
//Use pop() or shift() instead.
