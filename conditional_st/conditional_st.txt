
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false

Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

---------------------------------------------------------


The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.



When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution inside the switch block.

It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.

The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match:

The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block:

The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.
