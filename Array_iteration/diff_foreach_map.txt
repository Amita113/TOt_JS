The map() method returns a new array, whereas the forEach() method does not return a new array. 

The map() method is used to transform the elements of an array, whereas the forEach() method is used to loop through the elements of an array.


currentElement: This is the current element that is being processed in the callback.

indexOfElement: The index of that current element inside the array.

array: The array on which the whole operation is being performed.

Differences between forEach() and map() methods:

 	forEach()	map() 
1	The forEach() method does not returns a  new array based on the given array.	
The map() method returns an entirely new array.

2	The forEach() method returns “undefined“.	
The map() method returns the newly created array according to the provided callback function.

3	The forEach() method doesn’t return anything hence the method chaining technique cannot be applied here. 

	With the map() method, 
    we can chain other methods like, reduce(),sort() etc.

4.	It is not executed for empty elements.	
It does not change the original array.
